<h1>White Label On-Demand Delivery Service</h1>

The goal of the project is to develop a white label (food) delivery app, with the long-term goal of providing a solution for the distribution of dairy and non-dairy products, but also other food products. This includes an app for mobile customer terminals.  

This document deals with the first milestone, creating the mobile app for the end customer ("customer app") and all the API endpoints, databases, and services required for it.
